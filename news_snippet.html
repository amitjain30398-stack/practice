                Nvidia has become the world's first $5 trillion company, driven by immense demand for its AI chips. This
                valuation surpasses the combined GDP of Japan, the UK, and India, underscoring investor confidence in
                its AI infrastructure leadership. However, regulators warn of potential market overheating amidst rapid
                capital flows into the AI sector.

                            Nvidia Corp has become the world’s first $5 trillion company, marking another milestone in
                            the
                            artificial intelligence (AI) revolution reshaping global markets. The Silicon Valley
                            chipmaker
                            crossed the landmark just three months after breaching the $4 trillion mark, as its stock
                            soared
                            on the back of surging demand for AI chips and new strategic tie-ups, according to an AP
                            report.
                            <br><br>
                            Nvidia shares jumped 5.16% to $211.41 in early US trading on October 29 (9:36 am GMT-4),
                            extending
                            their blistering rally that has made the company the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The
                            stock
                            has risen sharply since early 2023, fuelled by a global rush for AI computing power.

                            The company’s $5.05 trillion market capitalisation now exceeds the combined GDP of Japan,
                            the UK
                            and India, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The milestone highlights the
                            scale of
                            investor confidence in Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure-- a technology wave widely
                            seen
                            as the most disruptive since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years
                            ago.

                            However, global regulators have begun to warn of overheating in the sector. The Bank of
                            England recently cautioned that soaring valuations of AI-linked tech stocks could create a
                            market bubble, while IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has echoed similar concerns
                            about the rapid pace of capital flows into the AI space.
